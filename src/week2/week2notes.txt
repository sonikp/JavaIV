  experiment with heapsize parameters <= hint
  ?? integer overflow
  
  
  test for min/max inter val
  test boundary: 1st, last, mid
  test midpoint test
  
  sum overflow that happens
  calculate midpoint given high/low
  test boundary with size = 1
  test empty array
  test basic smoke test: binary search, assert = to find key
  
  problem has to do with midpoint high + low / 2
