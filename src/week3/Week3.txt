Chapter 8 : Learning Java

Generics
- about abstraction
- create classes and methods that work same on different types of objects
- AKA parameterized types


The Java Collections Framework
Containers

- List - holds ordered collection of elements of type Object
- Map - holds key:value pairs
- HashMap - 

Casts

Collections	- java.util.Collections;

Java Collections Framework provides:
- interfaces
- algorithms

Interfaces:
- Collection
	- List
	- Set
		- SortedSet
- Map
	- SortedMap

List Classes:
- ArrayList
	- AbstractSequentialList
- AbstractList
	- AbstractSequentialList
- LinkedList

Set Classes:
- SortedSet
	- TreeSet
- HashSet
- AbstractSet

Sets (defined)
- a group of unique items, no duplicates
- infinite/finite
- can define abstract concepts

Lists (defined)
- elements listed in order
- can contain duplicate items

Map (defined)
- map is a set of pairs key:value

Differences "collections/maps"
- collections : can add/remove/lookup isolate items in a collection
- maps : key/value pairs

NOTE:
	- Collection interface is a group of objects with duplicates allowed
	- Set extends Collection but forbids duplicates
	- List extends Collection and allows duplicates, or positional indexing
	- Map extends neither Set or List or Collection
	
Set Interface
- Set is a collection that cannot contain duplicate elements
- Set interface extends Collection 
- contain only methods inherited from Collection
- two Set objects are equal if they contain the same elements
	- Intersection - two set values that contain the same elements
	- Union - combining two sets to create a new set of all the unique data elements
 
 Java Lists
 - List is an ordered Collections, aka sequence
 - can contain duplicates
 - contains List specific operations
 	- Positional access
 	- search
 	- List Iteration
 	- Range-view
 	
 Java Maps
 - accessing Map elements
 - Map does not inherit from Collection
 - Map interface provides for storing and accessing both key/value objects
 
 Iterator
 - an object that implements the Iterator interface generates a series of elements, one at a time
 	- hasNext()
 	- next()
 	- remove()
 
 ListIterator
 - interface extends Iterator
 - forward/reverse directions are possible
 
 Implementation Classes
 	- Set
 		- HashSet
 		- TreeSet
	- List
		- ArrayList
		- LinkedList
	- Map 
		- HashMap
		- TreeMap
		
Questions: Choosing an Implementation
- Fast random access by key	: Map
- Access data by key with frequent need to traverse the set of keys in order : Map
- No duplicates allowed : Set
- Frequent need to report sorted individual data elements : List
- Duplicates allowed, need to access data by position, new elements usually added to the end : Array
- Duplicates allowed, usual need is to traverse the collection in order : Sorted ArrayList
